We have completed our project. We have implemented adding a character to the game, playing the guess who game in player vs. player mode as well as player vs. computer. 
When a character is added, a file is created with all the character's characteristics and the path to that file is added to a master list of the paths to all the characters. Using deriving Read and deriving Show, we were able to store and read in the Character (which is a data type) without parsing. Then we implemented all the logic and functionality for the guess who game in which we allow users to guess characteristics and eliminate the characters that don't have the characteristics the same as the hidden character. The player will win if they whittle down the characters to the last one or guess the name correctly. In computer vs. player mode, the computer calculates the most optimal choice and eliminates based on which characteristic is most evenly distributed so no matter which characteristic is eliminated, it will be the most successful either way. 
We choose the characters for the players randomly from the list based on a number generated using the current time. We also use a Statistic data type to keep track of the statistics for each mode separately.
